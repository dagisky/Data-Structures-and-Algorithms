# Data Structures and Algorithms

These codes cover the key ideas involved in designing algorithms. We shall see how some structures and algorithms are more efficient than others for the same task. We will concentrate on a few basic tasks, such as storing, sorting, and searching data, that are fundamentals of computer science. All codes are implemented in both Java and Python.

## Installation
Unless stated in the readme of the given section, the rest of the code snippets only need basic installation of Python and Java.
